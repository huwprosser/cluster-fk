#welcome to cluster-fk!
Image clustering for objects and faces using Tensorflow, DeepFace and DBSCAN clustering.

This code provides a series of classes that enable simple clustering of images. Room for improvement!

✅ Object Clustering.

✅ Face Clustering.

✅ Visual window utils.

❌ Different file types.


DBSCAN clustering can be learned about here:

If you know how many classes you're trying to cluster, this is not for you. Checkout this:#
